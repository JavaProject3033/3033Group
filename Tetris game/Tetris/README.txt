|		How to Use the System
| ===================================================

Run the program using a compiler (ex. Eclipse). The program will 
start in the main menu. From there, there are two options:
	1. Play Game - allows you to play Tetris.
	2. Options - takes you to the options scene where the volume
		     can be adjusted.

Here are the rules for the actual game (mostly the same as the 
instructions in the game scene:
	1. Game ends when the blocks get past the top row.
	2. Clear blocks by filling up rows or putting similar colors
	   together (at least three blocks of the same color).
	3. Get higher scores by surviving longer.

Here are the controls for the actual game:
	right/left arrow keys 	move the block left/right
	down arrow key		move blocks down faster
	z			rotate left
	x			rotate right

When the game ends, it will automatically take you to the end game 
scene. To go back to the main menu, click the "Back to Main Menu" 
button.

To exit the program at any time, the close program button in the 
top right corner can be used.
